# bf-farm-simulator-9000
A
[BF Farm Simulator Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BFG_(weapon))
on steroids, MMORPG like you've never seen before.

## Goals

The goal of this project is, to showcase components of a Backend Web Application
using Java, Spring Boot, and the Spring Framework. 
Also, Domain Driven Design with Hexagonal Application Architecture. For the
Project Architecture, the monolith is chosen ( vs. the Microservices
Architecture). 

The hope is, to contribute to teh continuous efforts of the industry, to make
software development much, much cheaper. Imagine if with IT alone, we could
establish, a decrease of 30% on average, of products in supermarkets globally.

Cheap IT means a cheaper world for all of us!

This project is by no means meant as a real world game to be played. However,
if enthusiasts feel the need or the opportunity to make it a production level 
game, of course that would be wonderful!
